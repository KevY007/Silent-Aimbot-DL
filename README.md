# Silent-Aimbot-DL
0.3.DL Standalone Silent Aimbot (.ASI) (Partially supported on 0.3.7 but no support/broken)


Commands:
/aimfl_remove, /aimfl_add, /aimfl_reload
/configaim


.ASI at release section.

0.3.7 isn't working if I'm not mistaken, never had the motivation to fix it as there is SAMPFuncs for 0.3.7.

Incompat with s0biet etc.

Visual Studio C++ 2019 redists required.
